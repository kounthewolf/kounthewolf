Hi, my name is Koun. 
Grew up as a diplomatic kid, 
studied banking and finance,
and worked as a Fund Manager in Switzerland.

Our project "Wastebridge" was first thought in 2018,
now we want to fully implement it. 

Our aim: Introduce blockchain technology into the recycling and waste management ecosystem.
